# Problem Statement
Making decisions is hard. Data can help people to make more informed decisions but the process of collecting, processing, and generating reports that are easy to understand for non-technical audience requires a lot of time. We want to help solve this problem by developing a web application with the integration of AI to generate insightful reports to help policy-makers prioritize actions.
